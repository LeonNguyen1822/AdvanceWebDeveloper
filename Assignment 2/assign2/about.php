    <ul>
      <li>I have attempted to deploy and completed all tasks.</li>
      <li>The unique features that I added when building the site were:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Error handling and testing for MySQL connections: Send the user back to an error page with the appropriate error code and message.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>After a few tries, I was able to figure out the add friend page's common friend count and total friend count, which had previously given me difficulties.
      <li>While developing the website, I also encountered issues with the add friend feature.</li>
      <li>I want to build the program in a better structure next time, choose a reliable web hosting service, optimize database design, implement security measures, enhance user authentication, create a responsive design, implement pagination and sorting, provide clear error messages, manage sessions securely, implement logging and debugging, improve user profiles, add search functionality, implement email notifications, build a friend request system, implement user messaging, focus on UX design, conduct thorough testing, create documentation, ensure scalability, implement backup and recovery procedures, and set up performance monitoring tools.</li>
      <li>The additional features that I added to the assignment were:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Bootstrap and extra CSS are used for styling and navigation.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
